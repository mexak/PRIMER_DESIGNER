# PRIMER_DESIGNER
## Design primers for your cloning!

The PRIMER_DESIGNER application is a tool for bioingeneering which will automatically design primers for cloning particular insert to plasmid of choice, cut by chosen enzymes.
In first step, user can choose a plasmid from database, into which insert will be cloned:

After choosing one of available plasmids, user enters insert sequence:

Another view shows restriction enzymes which restriction sites are present in plasmid and not present in insert sequence.

In next step, after user chooses enzymes for cutting plasmid and insert, application will design primers for insert amplification.
